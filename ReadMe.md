This was a short project that i did because i wanted to delve into wiring with a microcontroller. For now the code on it is the original that came on the chip, but the wiring and perfboard are done by me.
im considering to also try out to reprogram it myself so that i could also learn a little assembly, but for now i have other projects calling.

I tried to program it for a while but either i dont get how to do it or its flash protected. because i could just not get it to connect. (i was also trying to use an arduino as a usb to serial, but thats totally not why it didnt work)
